Onelab/Mobile (http://onelab.info) is a finite element package based on the open
source mesh generator Gmsh (http://gmsh.info) and the solver GetDP
(http://getdp.info). It can be used to simulate a wide variety of multi-physic
problems: electromagnetics, thermics, mechanics...

Onelab/Mobile comes packaged with a selection of ready-to-use examples. New
models can be added through iTunes file sharing on iOS devices, or opened
directly on your devices on Android: see http://onelab.info/wiki/Mobile for more
information.

Onelab/Mobile is available on the AppStore and the Google Play store:
